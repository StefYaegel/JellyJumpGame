# JellyJumpGame

Jelly Jump is a single player browser-based 2D platform game that requires a balance between speed, skill, and patience to win. Players must outwit traps, dodge random obstacles, maneuver along platforms, collect coins and fruit, and reach the finish line all while in a race against the clock.

It was developed in Unity. For more information about Jelly Jump, check out the Gameplay Manual [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ftoDtEbtIZxxYkRfI4hib5vyOLmJgSQD/view?usp=sharing)
